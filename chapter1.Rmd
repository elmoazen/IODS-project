# About the project

**The objective of the course is to become familiar with (R) programming, and it was recommended by one of my colleagues. I learned how to install and configure the software necessary for statistical programming. I faced some difficulties in syncing files with GitHub (sometimes it works and sometimes it gives me error messages). I hope the situation will be much easier going forward. I wish the course covered practical issues in statistical computing, R programming, reading data, and writing functions. *
