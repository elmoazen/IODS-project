## Summary of the variables 

```{r}

           summary(learning2014)  
           table(learning2014$gender)

# 2.3 Choose three variables as explanatory variables and fit a regression model

```{r}
            reg_Model <- lm(points ~ attitude + deep+ stra , data = learning2014)
        
            # print out a summary of the model
               summary(reg_Model)
               coefficients(reg_Model)
          

               
               
 # the Best fitted model 
               fit_Model <- lm(points ~ attitude + stra , data = learning2014)

## The signficant fitted model 
               fit_Model2 <- lm(points ~ attitude , data = learning2014)

```
* __intercept__ : 15.4000 which is the points when all other points are 0.
          
* __coefficient of determination__ : (R-squared= 0.2154) : measure of how close the data are to the fitted line. It represents the proportion of the exam points which is explained by the explanatory variables (attitude, deep and stra). So it is here 21.5%.
               
* __Adjusted R-squared__ :  0.195 it is lower the R-squared because some explanatory variables are not contributing in description of exam points.
  
* __The F-test__  has a very low associated p-value, so there is very strong evidence that NOT all the three regression coefficients are zero.
 
* __t-test__ is used to test association of exam points with each explanatory variable ( t-value obtained by dividing the estimated regression coefficient by the standard error of the estimate) 
 
* the associated significance levels Will not indicate the importance of the explanatory variables in all cases. The only significant p value is attitude. But to have the higher adjusted R-squared we use both attitude and strategic learning. 

**The only significant p value is attitude.**

* __intercept__ :8.9729 which is the points when all other points are 0


* __Multiple R-squared__ := 0.2048) : measure of how close the data are to the fitted line. It represents the proportion of the exam points which is explained by the explanatory variables (attitude, deep and stra). So it is here 20.5%. lower than the first model as it has less variables. 


* __Adjusted R-squared__ :0.1951 which it is lower the R-squared because some explanatory variables are not contributing in description of exam points
               
* __the relation__ :  Exam point= 8.9729+ (3.466* attitude) + (0.0914 *strategic learning)



# 2.5 Diagnostic plots
```{r}
# Fifth Task:   .
              
# draw diagnostic plots Residuals vs Fitted values 1, Normal QQ-plot 2 and Residuals vs Leverage 5

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(fit_Model, which=c(1,2,5))


```


### Assumption: 

1. **Residual vs Fitted** : This plot is used to determine if the residuals exhibit non-linear patterns. If the red line across the center of the plot is roughly horizontal then we can assume that the residuals follow a linear pattern. In our model is almost horizontal so the linear regression model is appropriate for the dataset

2.  **Normal Q-Q** :This plot is used to determine if the residuals of the regression model are normally distributed. If the points in this plot fall roughly along a straight diagonal line, then we can assume the residuals are normally distributed. In our model most of the points are roughly along the diagonal line

3. **Residual vs Leverage** : This plot is used to identify influential observations. If any points in this plot fall outside of Cookâ€™s distance (the dashed lines) then it is an influential observation.
